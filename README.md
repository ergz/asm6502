# asm6502 README

ASM 6502 Syntax Highlighting, nothing else just the highlight. The TextMate grammar was copied 
from https://github.com/vanderhoorn/6502asm-tmbundle

This extension was created using this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide

I don't know JS so I assumed all defaults were good to go.

## Features

Only feature is that it colors your 6502 asm code.
